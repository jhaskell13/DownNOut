## Down N Out

### A simple monitoring and outage reporting system for various services.

The current implementation only checks Github services via their API and will send an email to admins. 
This project is mainly a learning tool to master Laravel's service container, events, and queue. 

Further versions will come with the following:
    - Slack and Webhook notifications
    - Http checker to check statuses of configured url addresses
    - Cached rate limiting
    - Further security enhancements
    - And more!
